# **Network Security Scan Report: Host 192.168.23.246**

Date of Scan: 2025-08-04  
Report Generated: 2025-08-04

## **1\. Executive Summary**

A TCP SYN scan was conducted on the host at IP address **192.168.23.246**. The scan revealed a total of **23 open TCP ports**. The services running on these ports present a **critical security risk** due to the presence of multiple unencrypted communication protocols, exposed administrative services, and open database connections. Immediate remediation is required to secure the host from potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware attacks.

## **3\. Open Ports and Services Discovered**

The following table details the ports found to be open on the target host and the services associated with them.

| Port | Protocol | State | Service | Risk Level | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 21 | TCP | open | ftp | **High** | Unencrypted file transfer. Credentials sent in cleartext. |
| 22 | TCP | open | ssh | Medium | Secure if properly configured, but a target for brute-force. |
| 23 | TCP | open | telnet | **High** | Unencrypted remote login. Credentials sent in cleartext. |
| 25 | TCP | open | smtp | Medium | Can be abused as an open email relay for spam. |
| 53 | TCP | open | domain | Medium | Can be used for DNS amplification attacks if misconfigured. |
| 80 | TCP | open | http | **High** | Unencrypted web traffic. Susceptible to eavesdropping. |
| 111 | TCP | open | rpcbind | Medium | Often a target for reconnaissance and exploits. |
| 139 | TCP | open | netbios-ssn | **High** | Legacy service, often vulnerable (e.g., WannaCry). |
| 445 | TCP | open | microsoft-ds | **High** | SMB service, a primary target for exploits like EternalBlue. |
| 512 | TCP | open | exec | **Critical** | Insecure "r-service" for remote execution. Must be disabled. |
| 513 | TCP | open | login | **Critical** | Insecure "r-service" for remote login. Must be disabled. |
| 514 | TCP | open | shell | **Critical** | Insecure "r-service" for remote shell. Must be disabled. |
| 1099 | TCP | open | rmiregistry | Medium | Java RMI, can be vulnerable to remote code execution. |
| 1524 | TCP | open | ingreslock | Low | Legacy service, potential for information disclosure. |
| 2049 | TCP | open | nfs | **High** | Network File System, can expose sensitive files if misconfigured. |
| 2121 | TCP | open | ccproxy-ftp | **High** | Alternate FTP port, carries the same risks as port 21\. |
| 3306 | TCP | open | mysql | **High** | Exposed database. Target for brute-force and data theft. |
| 5432 | TCP | open | postgresql | **High** | Exposed database. Target for brute-force and data theft. |
| 5900 | TCP | open | vnc | **High** | Remote desktop access. Often unencrypted or weakly secured. |
| 6000 | TCP | open | X11 | Medium | Can be used for keystroke logging or screen capture if exposed. |
| 6667 | TCP | open | irc | Medium | Can be abused for botnet command and control (C2). |
| 8009 | TCP | open | ajp13 | Medium | Connector for Apache Tomcat, known vulnerabilities (e.g., Ghostcat). |
| 8180 | TCP | open | unknown | Low | Unidentified service, requires further investigation. |

## **4\. Security Risk Analysis**

The combination of open ports on this host creates a large attack surface. The most critical risks are:

1. **Credential Exposure:** Services like **FTP, Telnet, and VNC** transmit data, including login credentials, in cleartext. An attacker on the same network could easily intercept this information.  
2. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Several services are known to have critical vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to take full control of the system. These include **microsoft-ds (SMB), the "r-services" (exec, login, shell), and potentially rpcbind and ajp13**.  
3. **Data Exfiltration:** With direct access to **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NFS**, an attacker could potentially steal or corrupt sensitive data stored on the host.  
4. **Information Leakage:** Services like RPC, NetBIOS, and DNS can be queried to reveal detailed information about the host and network, aiding an attacker in planning a more sophisticated attack.

## **5\. Recommendations and Remediation Steps**

The following actions should be taken immediately to mitigate the identified risks:

1. **Implement a Default-Deny Firewall Policy:** Configure a host-based or network firewall to **block all incoming traffic by default**. Only open the specific ports that are absolutely necessary for the host's function.  
2. **Disable Insecure and Unnecessary Services:**  
   * **Immediately disable Telnet, FTP, exec, login, and shell.** Use **SSH (port 22\)** for all remote access and file transfers (using SFTP or SCP).  
   * Disable NetBIOS and SMB (ports 139, 445\) if file sharing is not required. If it is, restrict access to trusted IPs only.  
   * Close database ports (3306, 5432\) to the public internet. Applications should connect over a private network or through a secure tunnel (e.g., SSH tunnel).  
3. **Enforce Encryption:**  
   * Enable **HTTPS** by installing an SSL/TLS certificate for the web server on port 80\.  
   * Ensure VNC and SSH connections are configured to use strong encryption and password policies.  
4. **Patch and Update:**  
   * Regularly update all software on the host, especially the operating system and services exposed to the network like Apache, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, to protect against known exploits.  
5. **Further Investigation:**  
   * Identify the unknown service running on port 8180 to determine if it is a business-critical application or a potential backdoor.
